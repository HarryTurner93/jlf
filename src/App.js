                        <p>
                            We are a newly registered charity, our goal is to support young people in distress
                            throughout Buckinghamshire by providing them with free counselling services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our services will be aimed at 11-19 year olds, who can self-refer through their
                            doctors, school or our website.

                        <h1>Our Story</h1>
                        <p>
                            This charity has been set up in the memory of Julius Little; a caring, compassionate and perhaps most importantly to him an artist and fashion icon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Julius himself suffered with anxiety and depression and sadly took his own life in June 2019, aged 20.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            His family created the foundation in order to help those struggling with mental illness just like Julius did.
                        </p>

                        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                        <p>
                            The statistics are bleak, I in 4 of us will suffer with a mental health problem this year and there are not currently enough resources available to help each of us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our young people face more and more challenges to their mental health and not everyone is receiving the support they need.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are here to help by providing young people a free, confidential, safe space to explore and discuss any troubles with trained mental health professionals.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The support we have received so far has been amazing! We thank everyone who has donated or given up their time fundraising and volunteering!

                        <p>
